            <img src="images/bacon.jpg" width = "400" alt="Brown labradoodle wearing colorful lei">
            <p>Bacon Q. Dog is a 9yr old labradoodle. He prefers to spend his days lounging among the three different beds/couches that his family has gifted him. He enjoys a walk or two around the neighborhood, as long as he can pretend that he doesn't see any of the other animals to avoid the embarrassment of not wanting to admit he has no wolf-like skills in chasing them.</p> 
            <P>At night just as the rest of the family is ready to relax, Bacon suddenly wants to release all of his energy. He will place his toys on a mini couch and frantically drag the couch around, giving his toys "a ride." There is also a lot of rolling. Lots and lots of rolling.</P>

            <img src ="images/cooper.jpeg" alt="Border collie and lab mix laying his head on his stuffed animal toy" width="400">
            <p>Cooper is an 8yr old border collie and lab mix. We rescued him from the Humane Society as a puppy! He loves going on long walks/runs, but he stops to sniff something every few steps. He‚Äôs pretty friendly, but he loves to loudly bark at delivery people who ring the doorbell.</p> 
            <p>Whenever it‚Äôs movie night, Cooper has to join on the couch/bed or he feels left out. He loves to cuddle and pats on his tummy. Cooper will play fetch for about 2 or 3 rounds, but he quickly gets bored. He leaves his toys all around the house for the rest of the family to find.</p>

            <img src ="images/Main.jpg" width="400" alt = "Milktea taking nap">
            <p>Milktea is a Scottish fold with a personality of a princess. She loves her veggies and refuses to eat anything dropped on the ground. She makes it clear when she has a demand of any sort by complaining in a loud, distinguished manner. If what she says could be translated, it probably would be, ‚ÄúThis is atrocious, the water container has been empty for the 3rd time this week. I want to see the manager.‚Äù</p>
            <p>Despite her cuteness and royalty, she actually suffers from a genetic disorder intentionally brought upon by humans. I highly advise against keeping a Scottish fold because they are in constant pain when they reach around 2 years old. Cartilage accumulates around her paw joints and tail joints and it becomes painful for them to even walk. She is living evidence of human‚Äôs cruelty of breeding animals to look pretty while sacrificing the animals‚Äô health.</p>

            <img src ="images/Leo_primary_photo.jpg" width="400" alt = "Guinea pig doing his best to smile for the camera">
            <p>Guinea pigs are a naturally energetic animal, who spend up to 20 hours a day awake. Despite being awake for long periods of time, they naturally hide in their habitats, and can be difficult to see in their inclosures.  Guinea pigs naturally are social creatures that enjoy socializing with other guinea pigs, in the wild they form packs of five to ten.</p>
            <p>Leo is a half-lazy, half-lively guinea pig that either likes to run around on the floor, doing tiny hops, or likes to lay down in the cage for hours at a time nibbling at hay. His favorite hobby is eating, and he can tell whenever someone is about to give good to him by waiting at the end of the cardboard box patio he has attached to his cage.</p>

            <p>He does not like any toys anymore as when he was younger, he watched a bigger toy shred his favorite one to pieces. He used to know how to roll over, but now replaced that memory with a spin as it is much easier.</p>
